# LendingClub 2.0.0

* Changed the overall API to include the lc_ prefix.  This will improve the user experience with better code completion. Original functions are deprecated but have not been removed. 
* Added unit tests via the testthat package and codecov.io. Current coverage is 54%
* Lending Club updated the folio secondary market API which affected several functions: 
    * The loanId and orderId are no longer required to purchase notes on the secondary market.  These arguments are deprecated from the  <code>FolioBuy</code> and <code>FolioSell</code> functions. The change is non-breaking but the function will return a warning if these arguments are passed in the function call.
    * The <code>FolioOrders</code> function was added to see either buy or sell orders submitted in the current month. 
    * The <code>FolioListing</code> function now able to filter the results by the time elapsed since the note was 
updated. The function executes much faster.
* Bug fixes
